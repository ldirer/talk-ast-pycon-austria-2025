# Python's Abstract Syntax Tree: Practical and Unpractical Uses

Slides and some code for the talk I gave at PyCon Austria 2025.

## Objective

My goal was to demystify the concept of abstract syntax trees (AST).  
The name is a bit scary, and it often comes up in conversations on topics (compilers, interpreters) that are usually not familiar to a junior software engineer.

But it's not that hard to get started and benefit from the magic of AST manipulations.

## Abstract

Peek under the hood of Python and unlock the power of its Abstract Syntax Tree! We’ll demystify the AST, explore how it powers tools like pytest, linters, and refactoring, and experiment with more… creative transformations.

What is the Python Abstract Syntax Tree and why should you care? In this talk, we’ll demystify the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and show how it powers tools you probably already use - in Python and other languages.

We’ll take a close look at pytest assert rewrite as a motivating and empowering example of how AST transformations work.

ASTs (and their cousins, the Concrete Syntax Trees) drive many real-world applications, from linters to automatic refactoring. We’ll mention some modern tools you might want to use.

Armed with newfound confidence, we’ll explore more creative transformations.

You’ll leave this talk with a deeper understanding of Python’s internals and a few terrible ideas for AST-powered tools.

This talk is beginner-friendly, no prior AST knowledge required.
